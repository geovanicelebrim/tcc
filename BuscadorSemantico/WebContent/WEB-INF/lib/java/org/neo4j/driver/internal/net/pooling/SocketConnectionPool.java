/**
 * The pool is designed to buffer certain amount of free sessions into session pool. When closing a session, we first
 * try to return the session into the session pool, however if we failed to return it back, either because the pool
 * is full or the pool is being cleaned on driver.close, then we directly close the connection attached with the
 * session.
 *
 * The session is NOT meant to be thread safe, each thread should have an independent session and close it (return to
 * pool) when the work with the session has been done.
 *
 * The driver is thread safe. Each thread could try to get a session from the pool and then return it to the pool
 * at the same time.
