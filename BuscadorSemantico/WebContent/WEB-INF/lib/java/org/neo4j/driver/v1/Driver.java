/**
 * A Neo4j database driver, through which you can create {@link Session sessions} to run statements against the database.
 * <p>
 * An example:
 * <pre class="doctest:DriverDocIT#exampleUsage">
 * {@code
 * // Create a driver with default configuration
 * Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver( "bolt://localhost:7687" );
 *
 * // Establish a session
 * Session session = driver.session();
 *
 * // Running a simple statement can be done like this
 * session.run( "CREATE (n {name:'Bob'})" );
 *
 * // Or, run multiple statements together in an atomic transaction:
 * try( Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction() )
 * {
 *     tx.run( "CREATE (n {name:'Alice'})" );
 *     tx.run( "CREATE (n {name:'Tina'})" );
 *     tx.success();
 * }
 *
 * // Retrieve results
 * StatementResult result = session.run( "MATCH (n) RETURN n.name" );
 * List<String> names = new LinkedList<>();
 * while( result.hasNext() )
 * {
 *     names.add( result.next().get("n.name").asString() );
 * }
 *
 * // Sessions are pooled, to avoid the overhead of creating new connections - this means
 * // it is very important to close your session when you are done with it, otherwise you will
 * // run out of sessions.
 * session.close();
 *
 * // And, to clean up resources, always close the driver when your application is done
 * driver.close();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *
 * A driver maintains a connection pool for each Neo4j instance. For resource efficiency reasons you are encouraged
 * to use the same driver instance across your application. You can control the connection pooling behavior when you
 * create the driver using the {@link Config} you pass into {@link GraphDatabase#driver(URI, Config)}.
